* make the graph page not die when a user has voted but not completed survey info
** just make it so that when a user is created, she is given default survey data

* make everything more pretty


gabrovski's soiling of the charts list:

-allow filtering by gender and age range (not so important)
-TEST for multiple users. no idea how to do that. In the worst case - install on castr and run manual tests there (grim)
-after completing all of this susccessfully tweak the chart so that it looks less like a horror movie with zombie geeks. clean up code and delete unnecessary sections. add arguments for size of chart and such...










(1) Visualization =============

This could be done by using the aforementioned Google visualization
API (see, e.g. "annotated timeline chart" in the gallery
(http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery.html).

Basically, we need to read timestamped data from the database, and
draw a chart displaying 1) the volume, i.e. number of clicks per
segment of time 2) the actual value, which should be the sum of th
ratings values entered during that segment, normalized by the number
of voters.  I'd say we should do something similar to Google stock
trading charts (except in color).

Configurable elements would include 1) length of the unit segment (1
sec, 3 sec, 1 min - whatever the user chooses the scale to be) 2)
subgroups of users for which the chart is drawn (e.g. the user should
be able to choose only males, only females, only Republicans, etc. -
whatever sociological parameters we have made available).  We could
probably allow more than one plot line per chart (e.g. Republicans vs.
Democrats) - so maybe the demo version should have checkboxes for each
of the relevant sociological parameters.

============

We should probably have 4 possible responses: +, ++, -, --.  That
would assume people are not likely to enter neutral responses, but are
likely to differentiate between something they like and something they
like very much. The associated values could be 1, 2, -1, -2, so that
the normalized sum gives us a neutral value if the votes split.

I'd make the gender into a drop-box, and check that age is
numeric with JS at the front end; also, we may spook people asking for
names, so maybe call it "nickname" and/or just put "(optional)" next
to it?
* this form should probably be a django form. this will give us some of these things for free, i think

start working on flash video sync
* the chart is clickable, and the click opens up a player at the specified offset, so that the user could see what people were responding to during a given segment.
